# Investment Management CRUD Application

This is a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application built with JavaScript. It allows users to manage investment solutions for clients at Cytonn Investments Management. The application covers various JavaScript concepts such as functions, closures, prototypes, objects, encapsulation, inheritance, and strict mode.

## Features

- **Create:** Users can add new investment solutions for clients by providing their name and chosen investment solution.
- **Read:** Users can view all existing investment solutions in a table format.
- **Update:** Users can update the chosen investment solution for a client.
- **Delete:** Users can remove an existing investment solution for a client.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML:** Provides the structure and layout for the application.
- **CSS:** Styles the application for a visually appealing user interface.
- **JavaScript:** Implements the CRUD functionality and manages the application's logic.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
3. Enter the client's name and chosen investment solution.
4. Use the provided buttons to create, read, update, or delete investment solutions.

  - `app.js`: Implements the JavaScript functionality for CRUD operations.
